# vsgPhysX

Integration between the VulkanSceneGraph and PhysX.

## Licence

SPDX: MIT

The first few commits had the LGPL licence as I'd not yet checked whether everything was sufficiently distinct from osgPhysX to not count as derivative, or in places where it was, whether they were too trivial to copyright or copying was permissible on fair use grounds.
Now I *have*, I can grant availability of all parent commits of the one that changed the licence under the same MIT licence, too, and am writing this sentence to do so without having to rewrite the Git history.
