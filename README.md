# vsgPhysX

Integration between the VulkanSceneGraph and PhysX.

## Licence

SPDX: LGPL-3.0-or-later

### Why the LGPL?

osgPhysX used it, and I looked at that too much while working on this to be able to confidently say this isn't a derivative work.

### What that means

The short version is that if you want to use this library, you'll either need to make your project GPL/LGPL (or similar), or you'll want to put this library and any changes you make to it in their own DLL/shared library, and give the source code for that DLL to anyone you gave the DLL itself to if they ask for it.

Double check with your lawyer, as this might not be quite right, and there are other ways to comply that you might find to be easier.

### Why do some files have the MIT licence at the top?

These contain loads of stuff directly copied and pasted from the VSG itself, so it'd be silly not to use the same licence.
